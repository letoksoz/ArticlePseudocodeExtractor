Pseudo code Data and Conversion

Note that this project is still in development. Please do not share any of the data or code.

PseudocodeExtractor is a java project and used for extracting and reformatting the pdfs installed from arxix data stored in Amazon S3 bucket.
Incoder_pseudocode_convertion.ipynb is where extracted pseudocodes are converted to python functions using the pretrained Incoder6B.
We also prepared a sample pseudo-code input data located in the data folder to quickly test the pseudocode to code conversion using the Incoder_pseudocode_convertion.ipynb file.

The extracted list of 90 000 pseudo codes along with their reformatted version can be found in the link below. We also included a reference text file inside the link displaying meta-information of all downloaded pdf files and shows which one of them has pseudo code in them.
